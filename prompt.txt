My secondary domains:  [Problem Solving & Prioritization, Communication & Collaboration]



My unique perspectives: [domains: I have built some simple CRUD apps, my culture: I believe that the value of my life should be a return from the value I add to people's life, life experiences: I have been through thick and think, my programming learning as not been easy at all, and I can see how software is shaping the entire world and culture, so I believe so much in the power of technology to make this world a better place and this is my passion in tech and reason why I haven't giving up despite my bad experiences as a self learning developer]



My LinkedIn profile: [lets leave this for now]

I’m eager to engage in a dialogue where you:

– Ask me thought-provoking questions to uncover my true aspirations



– Analyze my background and identify potential learning paths



– Help me refine my goals and create an actionable plan



– Provide insights and resources to support my development



– Present me with possible roadmaps, and we discuss the pros and cons of each one



– Engage in real-world scenarios to test my knowledge



– Find intersections among these elements to suggest promising learning paths that align with my strengths and interests, and with the vision in my vision board.
